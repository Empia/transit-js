# transit-js

Transit is a data format and a set of libraries for conveying values between applications written in different languages. This library provides support for marshalling Transit data to/from JavaScript.

* [Rationale](http://i-should-be-a-link)
* [API docs](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-java/)
* [Specification](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)

## Releases and Dependency Information

* Latest release: TBD
* [All Released Versions](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.cognitect%22%20AND%20a%3A%22transit-cljs%22)

### JavaScript

You can include either the development or release build of transit-js in
your webpage.

### Node.js

transit-js is released to [npm](https://www.npmjs.org). Add transit-js to your `package.json` dependencies.

### Bower

### Maven

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) dependency information:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.cognitect</groupId>
  <artifactId>transit-js</artifactId>
  <version>TBD</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

From the browser transit-js is available at the top level:

```javascript
var t = transit;

function roundtrip(x) {
  var r = t.reader("json"),
      w = t.writer("json"),
  return t.read(r, t.write(w, x));
}

function testRoundtrip() {
  var arr1 = ["red", "green", "blue"],
      arr2 = ["apple", "pear", "grape"]
      data = t.map();
  data.set(t.integer(1), list1);
  data.set(t.integer(2), list2);
  return t.equals(data, roundtrip(data));
}
```

From Node.js you must require transit-js:

```javascript
var t = require("transit");

function roundtrip(x) {
  var r = t.reader("json"),
      w = t.writer("json"),
  return t.read(r, t.write(w, x));
}

function testRoundtrip() {
  var arr1 = ["red", "green", "blue"],
      arr2 = ["apple", "pear", "grape"]
      data = t.map();
  data.set(t.integer(1), list1);
  data.set(t.integer(2), list2);
  return t.equals(data, roundtrip(data));
}
```

## Development

### Dependencies

Building and testing transit-js requires
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Install the project's additional
development dependencies with the following command from the repo
directory:

```
bin/deps
```

In order to build transit-js for
[ClojureScript](http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript),
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org) must be installed.

### Running the tests

```
bin/test
```

In order to run the `bin/verify` tests from
[transit-clj](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj), you must first
build the production Node.js build:

```
bin/build_release_node
```

### Build

#### Version

The build version is automatically incremented.  To determine the
current build version:

```
build/revision
```

#### Build for Node.js

```
bin/build_release_node
```

#### Build for Browser

```
bin/build_release_browser
```

#### Building the documentaiton

```
bin/docs
```

#### Build JAR for ClojureScript

The following will install a JAR suitable for use from ClojureScript
into your local Maven repository.

```
build/package
```

#### Deploy

Deployment requires that the AWS CLI tools be installed (see
https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

The deploy script runs the package script, and then deploys the
artifacts to the S3 bucket "mrel".  To deploy:

    build/deploy
