# transit-js

## Dependencies

Building and testing transit-js requires
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Install the project's additional
development dependencies with the following command from the repo
directory:

```
bin/deps
```

In order to build transit-js for
[ClojureScript](http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript),
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org) must be installed.

## Running the tests

```
bin/test
```

In order to run the `bin/verify` tests from
[transit-clj](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj), you must first
build the production Node.js build:

```
bin/build_release_node
```

## Build

### Version

The build version is automatically incremented.  To determine the
current build version:

```
build/revision
```

### Build for Node.js

```
bin/build_release_node
```

### Build for Browser

```
bin/build_release_browser
```

### Build JAR for ClojureScript

The following will install a JAR suitable for use from ClojureScript
into your local Maven repository.

```
